## Project Description
The project involves:
- Performing data cleaning on the Titanic dataset.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover insights.
- Visualizing various aspects of the data to understand relationships between variables.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/eda-titanic-dataset.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd eda-titanic-dataset
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). If included, the dataset file is `train.csv`.

## Code and Analysis
The notebook (`.ipynb`) and Python script (`.py`) files include the code for:
- Data cleaning:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Exploratory data analysis:
  - Visualizations of survival distribution.
  - Survival rates by gender, passenger class, and embarkation location.
  - Age distribution and correlation heatmap.

## Results
Key visualizations from the analysis include:
- **Survival Distribution**:

## How to Run
1. To run the project, open the `eda_titanic.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step.
2. If using the Python script:
    ```bash
    python eda_titanic.py
    ```
